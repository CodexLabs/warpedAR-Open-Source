warpedAR
========

warpedAR is an application which shows how to build an effective Augmented Reality Solution using Appcelerator Titanium.

It is released under the Apache Open Source License, you are free to use and manipulate this code as you require. If you have fixes or suggestions please contact me via trevor@thewarpedcoder.net

The application is described below.

Version 1.0 - IOS ONLY
______________________

In this version the application checks the sensors on the device and uses google places to show the data in the Augmented Reality space.

It uses a plain black screen for this and does no data update or altering the items (POI's) as you get closer or further away.

The next version will have the camera closely followed by the distance updates. It is not currently in this version as I thought it better to release early for feedback.

The main focus at the moment is to make this compatible with Android, which is not very far off.

An example application is awaiting approval in the app store so may be available NOW.. warpedAR.


To use this application you will need to input your own Google Places API key in the googleFeed.js file.
